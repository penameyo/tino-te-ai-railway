# Pre-Beta Feedback System Requirements

## Introduction

한국공대 전자공학부 편입학생들을 위한 Tino-te.ai Pre-Beta 테스트 시스템을 구축합니다. 이 시스템은 5명 내외의 프리-베타 테스터들로부터 체계적인 피드백을 수집하고, 주 3회(월, 수, 금) 간격으로 즉각적인 개선사항을 반영하여 학업 효율성 향상을 도모합니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: 피드백 수집 시스템

**User Story:** As a pre-beta tester, I want to easily provide feedback about the application, so that I can help improve the service for fellow transfer students.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the feedback button THEN the system SHALL redirect to a Naver Form
2. WHEN the feedback form is accessed THEN the system SHALL capture the user's session information for context
3. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL be accessible for immediate review by the development team

### Requirement 2: Pre-Beta Tester 관리

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage pre-beta tester accounts, so that I can control access and track usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pre-beta tester is added THEN the system SHALL create a special user account with beta privileges
2. WHEN a pre-beta tester logs in THEN the system SHALL display beta-specific UI elements including feedback button
3. WHEN viewing user lists THEN the system SHALL distinguish between regular users and pre-beta testers
4. IF a user is not a pre-beta tester THEN the system SHALL display "coming soon" message instead of full functionality

### Requirement 3: 배포 접근 제어

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to control public access to the application, so that only authorized pre-beta testers can use the system during testing phase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a non-authorized user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a "Pre-Beta Testing in Progress" message
2. WHEN an authorized pre-beta tester accesses the application THEN the system SHALL provide full functionality
3. WHEN the pre-beta phase ends THEN the system SHALL be easily switchable to public access mode

### Requirement 4: 피드백 주기 관리

**User Story:** As a development team, I want to track feedback submission timing, so that I can ensure the 3-times-per-week feedback schedule is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL timestamp the submission
2. WHEN viewing feedback analytics THEN the system SHALL show submission patterns by day of week
3. IF feedback frequency is below target THEN the system SHALL provide gentle reminders to testers

### Requirement 5: 학업 향상도 추적

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to track usage patterns and academic improvement indicators, so that I can evaluate the project's sustainability and effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pre-beta tester uses the application THEN the system SHALL log usage statistics
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide insights on feature usage and user engagement
3. WHEN the beta period ends THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive evaluation report

### Requirement 6: 즉각적인 개선사항 반영

**User Story:** As a pre-beta tester, I want to see my feedback implemented quickly, so that my learning process is not disrupted and I feel valued as a contributor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical feedback is received THEN the system SHALL support hot-fix deployments within the same week
2. WHEN major changes are needed THEN the system SHALL implement changes during weekend maintenance windows
3. WHEN changes are deployed THEN the system SHALL notify pre-beta testers of improvements made based on their feedback
